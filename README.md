# Benchmark

A Python module for approximation of time complexity of various functions based on the size of problem. 

The module has been written in Python 3.5 and is intended for use in that language.

Install with:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mprzewie/benchmark.git
```

For basic example of usage refer to [example.ipynb](https://github.com/mprzewie/benchmark/blob/master/example.ipynb) which you can run with Jupyter Notebook.

This has been an excercise for Python Programming class in 2017 by [dr. Leszek Grzanka](https://github.com/grzanka) at AGH UST, CS Course.
